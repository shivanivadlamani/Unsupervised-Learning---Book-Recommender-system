# Book Recommendation System
This repository contains the code for a book recommendation system. The system is built using the Book-Crossing dataset, which is a public dataset of book ratings and reviews.

# About the Project
The main objective of this project is to create a book recommendation system that can recommend books to users based on their past ratings and reviews. The system is built using a collaborative filtering approach, which means that it recommends books to users based on the ratings and reviews of other users who have similar tastes.

# The Dataset
The Book-Crossing dataset comprises 3 files:

users.csv: This file contains information about the users, such as their user ID, location, and age.
books.csv: This file contains information about the books, such as their ISBN, title, author, year of publication, and publisher.
ratings.csv: This file contains the book rating information. Ratings (Book-Rating) are either explicit, expressed on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation), or implicit, expressed by 0.

# The Code
The code for the book recommendation system is written in Python. The code is divided into two main parts:

The data processing code: This code cleans and preprocesses the data.
The recommendation system code: This code builds and evaluates the recommendation system.

# How to Use the Code
The code in this repository can be used to build your own book recommendation system. To use the code, you will need to download the Book-Crossing dataset and install the necessary Python packages.
